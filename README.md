# recover CS50/pset4
Recover is a program that recovers JPEGs from a forensic image.

In this task I had to figure out how JPG images is build 
and how it's stored in memory.

Recover.c is fully implemented by myself. In repository there are 49 JPEGs that were recovered from card.raw with the help of recover.c.
